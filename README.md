# 🎓 AI Coursework Portfolio

This repository contains selected Jupyter notebooks and Python projects developed during my postgraduate studies in Artificial Intelligence.

The content is organized progressively and will continue to grow as I upload new projects. Each notebook reflects applied work across topics such as:

- Machine Learning
- Data Visualization
- Sensor Networks and IoT
- Autonomous Systems and Robotics

> 🚧 More updates coming soon as I continue curating my work.
